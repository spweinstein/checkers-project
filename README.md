## How to Play

Checkers is a classic two-player strategy board game. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally across the board. The objective is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot move.

### Game Rules
- Pieces move diagonally on dark squares
- Regular pieces can only move forward
- Capture opponent pieces by jumping over them
- When a piece reaches the opposite end, it becomes a King
- Kings can move both forward and backward
